## Quarterly Priorities
This content is meant to communicate how I intend to allocate my time. I review it weekly, but it should largely remain consistent on the time-scales of quarters.

| Theme | Notes | Percent |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Team Development | CDF Reviews, Career Development, GitLab Values Coaching | 40% |
| Sensing Mechanisms | Customer interviews, analyst inquiries, competitive review | 15% |
| Cross Section Product Experience | Thnk Bigs, Walk-throughs, learning goals, direction content review | 15% |
| Product Management Leadership Priorities | North Star Metrics, Data and ROI focus | 10% |
| External Evangelism | Ops vision, analyst briefings, conference speaking | 10% |
| Core Team Engagement | UX, Development, Quality | 5% |
| Personal Growth / Leadership Opportunities | Representing GitLab externally, Representing Product internally | 5% |
| Hiring | Sourcing, interviewing, hiring | 0% |

## Weekly Priorities
This content is meant to communicate my priorities on a weekly basis. They should typically be reflected as items in the `Doing` of [my personal issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1353560?assignee_username=kencjohnston). It will be updated weekly. As I'm always striving to learn I'll also add a `Learning Goal` each week.
