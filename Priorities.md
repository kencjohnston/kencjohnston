## Weekly Priorities
This content is meant to communicate my priorities on a weekly basis. They should typically be reflected as items in the `Doing` of [my personal issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1353560?assignee_username=kencjohnston). It will be updated weekly. As I'm always striving to learn I'll also add a `Learning Goal` each week.
