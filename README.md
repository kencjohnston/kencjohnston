If we are working together, or even if we aren't, here are some things it might be helpful to know about me:

### General 
* I've worked in and around open-source for most of my technical career, I'm a firm believer in the [benefits of open code and open-society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/opensocd1.pdf) and the [importance of community](https://thenewstack.io/power-community-open-source/) in open-source projects.
* I had a previous career in political campaigns. While I [don't bring my political views to work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dont-bring-religion-or-politics-to-work), I do bring my belief that everyone desires to be a [valued member of a winning team on an inspiring mission](https://blog.rackspace.com/whats-core-rackspace-core-values). 
* My strengths tend towards the strategic, I work hard to focus on [getting things done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) while continuously [improving my strategic thinking skills](https://hbr.org/2016/12/4-ways-to-improve-your-strategic-thinking-skills). 
* For a strategic strengthed person I'm unsurprisingly task motivated - I enjoy breaking down tasks and checking off lists. I look at my [GitLab Activity](https://gitlab.com/kencjohnston) a bit too often.
* I'm demotivated by work without accomplishment. Meetings with conversation that doesn't end in something concrete frustrate me. Knowing I have a day full of non-action oriented meetings makes me want to hit the snooze button. 
* I often get bogged down in a search for efficiency, especially with new tasks. Feel free to call me out on it.
* I believe in [working smarter not harder](https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/work-smarter-not-harder-10-ways-to-be-more-effective-at-work.html), in an effort to [scale myself](https://firstround.com/review/our-6-must-reads-for-scaling-yourself-as-a-leader/). 
* I'm even-keeled. That can lead others to read into tone that wasn't there. I try to [prevent that from happening](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054178/5-ways-to-avoid-a-massive-email-misunderstanding).
* I've been known to come off as direct, and antagonistic in written communication. I can assure you I never intend to be antagonistic. I'm working on [conveying appropriate emotion](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#using-emojis-to-convey-emotion) in my direct, written communication. 
* I take my work seriously, but not myself. I think we could all use a little bit [more FUN in our work](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/288223).
* I enjoy receiving public praise, but private praise fuels me. 
* I'm never the smartest person in the room, if I share opinions consider them [Minimally Viable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#minimum-viable-change-mvc)
* I prefer to discuss things Directly, both with my teams and my manager. I'd rather know someone's direct intention rather then to be coached around an issue Socratically.
* I believe in [playing to your strengths](https://hbr.org/2005/01/how-to-play-to-your-strengths), and building complete teams based on coordinated strengths. 
* My dog [Petri](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team-pets/#87-petri) shows up frequently in Zoom calls. She's big, and can startle the un-initiated. Sometimes I'll leave my camera's view to let her outside. 
* Outside of work I love to cook, play soccer, build puzzles and travel. 

### Product
* I LOVE the function of Product Management. In my first tech-job after meeting a Product Manager I immediately thought - "That is what I want to do!"
* I'm a strong believer that while product managers are typically hyper-efficient individuals, they are one of the few individuals driving a company's effectiveness.
* I really enjoy coaching, mentoring and advising Product Managers. Do not hestitate to reach out to me.
* I'm working on striking the right balance between providing more direct input into Product Direction and empowering autonomy in teams I support. Please do not hesitate to call me out if I'm being overly directive.

### Management
* I aspire to be a servant leader, but I've got a long-way to go. Please provide me feedback to help me get there.
* I believe as a leader you get back what you give out. I once heard a talk that hypothesized that [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) tells us that if we want lovable results OUT of our teams, we have to have put love IN to them.
* I want each of my team members to know they are a valuable contributor to a winning team and give them an inspiring mission.
* I was changed by the book [Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/r), it helped me understand motivation in a new way.
* I tend to be direct, and I HATE micro-managing.
* I want to be the type of leader I'd like to have - Loving, Trusting, Fair and Consistent.

### Logistics
* I block off my calendar for school pick-up/dinner/bed-time from 3:00PM - 7:45PM CT.
* When you need to reach me, here are my communication priorities and preference:
    * GitLab issues - Direct mention me on issues, I prefer interacting with issues to all other collaboration mechanisms 
    * Email - I check email only periodically throughout the day. I have no alerts setup to inform me of newly arriving email. 
    * Slack - If I'm working, I'm on slack. For small group discussions, never hesitate to create a dedicated public chat room. Please avoid DMs unless they really need to be private.
    * SMS - I have my phone by my side during regular work hours to review texts or receive calls. Outside of work hours I'm hit or miss on SMS.
    * Phone - If I'm in a meeting I will let my phone go to voicemail. I only return calls that leave voicemails. If it is urgent, call my phone twice back-to-back and I will step out of what I'm doing to answer.
* I prefer to avoid email for the following activities:
    * Long dialog requiring discussion - better to create an issue, start a conversation on slack or setup a meeting
    * Requests for review - better to create an issue, or start a slack converation and ping the required reviewers
* I consider Slack to be asynchronous. If there is a timeline for a request you might have please specificy it. For example - "Hey, can you review the Kickoff list prior to the kickoff meeting tomorrow?"
* I'm an exclusive user of GitLab TODOs. Please @ mention me when responding to issues, otherwise I won't get the notification.
* I'm still learning how to balance [multi-modal communication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#multimodal-communication) and that can sometimes result in more annoyance then effectiveness. Please don't hesitate to call me out if you feel like I'm over-communicating.

### Teams I Support
I [support the Product Management team](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/org-chart/) responsible for the Ops Section stages at GitLab. 
* One easy way to keep me abreast of your priorities is to send a note in the #product Slack channel once a week and @ mention me. 
* Follow the [GitLab handbook when communicating time-off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off). No other notification or approval is required.
* I will never take offense to skip-leveling, if you have a concern [you can and should take it to whoever you think will be effective in alleviating it](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#communication-should-be-direct-not-hierarchical).
* Share what you learn, whether that is relevant articles, conference notes or TED talks.

### Adaptable
I never shy from feedback, constructive criticism or suggested improvements. It happens so rarely in the corporate world, I will ALWAYS thank you for it. Please consider this document in that context. I'm accepting [issue submissions](https://gitlab.com/kencjohnston/README/issues) and [merge request](https://gitlab.com/kencjohnston/README/merge_requests).

You can also provide me direct (anonymous) feedback by filling out my [ongoing feedback form](https://forms.gle/uQgn9acSgFesBKWe7).
