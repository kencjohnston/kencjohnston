## Kenny's README
My name is Kenny Johnston and I'm the Director of Product, Ops at GitLab.

If we are working together, or even if we aren't, here are some things it might be helpful to know about me:

### General 
* I've worked in and around open-source for most of my technical career, I'm a firm believer in the [benefits of open code and open-society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/opensocd1.pdf) and the [importance of community](https://thenewstack.io/power-community-open-source/) in open-source projects.
* I had a previous career in political campaigns. While I [don't bring my political views to work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#diversity), I do bring my desire to be a [valued member of a winning team on an inspiring mission](https://blog.rackspace.com/whats-core-rackspace-core-values). 
* My strengths tend towards the strategic, I work hard to focus on [getting things done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) while continuously [improving my strategic thinking skiills](https://hbr.org/2016/12/4-ways-to-improve-your-strategic-thinking-skills). 
* I often get bogged down in a search for efficiency, especially with new tasks. Feel free to call me out on it.
* I believe in [working smarter not harder](https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/work-smarter-not-harder-10-ways-to-be-more-effective-at-work.html), in an effort to [scale myself](https://firstround.com/review/our-6-must-reads-for-scaling-yourself-as-a-leader/). 
* I'm even-keeled. That can lead others to read into tone that wasn't there. I try to [prevent that from happening](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054178/5-ways-to-avoid-a-massive-email-misunderstanding).
* I take my work seriously, but not myself. 
* I'm never the smartest person in the room, if I share opinions consider them [Minimally Viable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration)
* I believe in [playing to your strengths](https://hbr.org/2005/01/how-to-play-to-your-strengths), and building complete teams based on coordinated strengths. 
* Outside of work I love to cook, play soccer, build puzzles and travel. 

### Logistics
* I block off my calendar prior to daycare/school drop-off at 8:30AM CT and for pick-up/dinner/bed-time from 4:45PM - 7:45PM CT.
* When you need to reach me, here are my communication priorities and preference:
    * Email - I check email only periodically throughout the day. I have no alerts setup to inform me of newly arriving email. 
    * Slack - If I'm working, I'm on slack. For small group discussions, never hesitate to create a dedicated public chat room. 
    * SMS - I have my phone by my side during regular work hours to review texts or receive calls. Outside of work hours I'm hit or miss on SMS.
    * Phone - If I'm in a meeting I will let my phone go to voicemail. I only return calls that leave voicemails. If it is urgent, call my phone twice back-to-back and I will setup out of what I'm doing to answer.
* I prefer to avoid email for the following activities:
    * Long dialog requiring discussion - better to create an issue, start a conversation on slack or setup a meeting
    * Requests for review - better to create an issue, or start a slack converation and ping the required reviewers
* I consider Slack to be asynchronous. If there is a timeline for a request you might have please specificy it. For example - "Hey, can you review the Kickoff list prior to the kickoff meeting tomorrow?"

### Teams I Support
I [support the Product Management team](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/org-chart/) responsible for the Ops and Secure Stages. 
* One easy way to keep me abreast of your priorities is to send a note in the #product Slack channel once a week and @ mention me. 
* Please send the team a no-reponse required, free-time, no reminder invite with the title "YOUR NAME - OoO" when you are going to be OoO for a day. Consider sending this to your core stakeholders as well.
* I will never take offense to skip-leveling, if you have a concern you can and should take it to whoever you think will be effective in alleviating it.
* Share what you learn, whether that is relevant articles, conference notes or TED talks.
