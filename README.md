If we are working together, or even if we aren't, here are some things it might be helpful to know about me:

### General 

* I block off my calendar prior to daycare/school drop-off at 8:30AM CT and for pick-up/dinner/bed-time from 4:45PM - 7:45PM CT.
* When you need to reach me, here are my communication priorities and preference:
    * Email - I check email only periodically throughout the day. I have no alerts setup to inform me of newly arriving email. 
    * Slack - If I'm working, I'm on slack. For small group discussions, never hesitate to create a dedicated public chat room. 
    * SMS - I have my phone by my side during regular work hours to review texts or receive calls. Outside of work hours I'm hit or miss on SMS.
    * Phone - If I'm in a meeting I will let my phone go to voicemail. I only return calls that leave voicemails. If it is urgent, call my phone twice back-to-back and I will setup out of what I'm doing to answer.
* I prefer to avoid email for the following activities:
    * Long dialog requiring discussion - better to create an issue, start a conversation on slack or setup a meeting
    * Requests for review - better to create an issue, or start a slack converation and ping the required reviewers
* I consider Slack to be asynchronous. If there is a timeline for a request you might have please specificy it. For example - "Hey, can you review the Kickoff list prior to the kickoff meeting tomorrow?"
* Outside of work I love to cook, play soccer, build puzzles and travel. 


### Product Management Team
* One easy way to keep me abreast of your priorities is to send a note in the #product Slack channel once a week and @ mention me. 
* Please send the team a no-reponse required, free-time, no reminder invite with the title "YOUR NAME - OoO" when you are going to be OoO for a day. Consider sending this to your core stakeholders as well.
